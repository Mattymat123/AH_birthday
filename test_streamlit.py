                      Rick as a person is best descriped as this : Rick is a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to several different dimensions, cloning technology, cybernetic implants, various energy weapons and force fields, and the world's first amusement park inside the body of a living human. His brilliance can be muddled by his jaded personal views and his alcoholic tendencies. Rick is easily bored and does not do well with routine. When his curse removing store in the episode "Something Ricked This Way Comes" started requiring real work, Rick simply lit the whole store on fire and abandoned it. He regularly goes to other dimensions to harvest resources and will often willingly kill aliens to get them. He is willing to be extremely brutal such as when people betray him or his life or those close to him are in danger. He is usually portrayed as homicidal and having a large disregard for life, enough that he came close to bombing the world with neutrinos while drunk. He was shown to find killing fun during the Purge and was even willing to kill Morty's half-Gazorpian son due to the child's danger to everyone and unstable nature.

Rick
This does not make him completely heartless, however, as he has been shown to be shocked, startled or annoyed by the loss of life that he deems unnecessary, foolish, or unreasonable. He was annoyed at Morty for letting Fart live, resulting in a chase with local police that cost many bystanders their lives. In addition to that, he was panicked when Unity destroyed an entire city that Rick thought still had people in it since he was unsure if Summer and Morty were there or not. He also was shocked and upset by people he was close to dying or nearly dying, such as when Mr. Poopybutthole was shot and he ran to his side in fear for the latter's life. When Bird Person was killed by Tammy, Rick flies into a rage, mowing down multiple Federation troops. In "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate", Rick gasps when seeing Jerry being shot several times, and left mutilated. During the time of the Festival, he only watched the killing for a few short seconds before becoming overwhelmed by the violence and vomiting. Later, when helping Arthricia get revenge against the upper class, he felt he had done enough killing and began to find it gratuitous. In the past, Rick was a "hero" like Space Beth but eventually stopped, deeming it a “phase”. In Unmortricken, upon witnessing the death of his uncle, Slow Mobius, an enraged Rick would attack his uncle's murderer, later killing him.

Contrary to popular belief, Rick is not a nihilist. Although his commonly-stated viewpoint on life may be the typical nihilistic idealism that "nothing has meaning", he doesn't always put his money where his mouth is. Rick expresses love and emotion for his family and lovers on an almost episodic basis. Plot relevant instances include "The ABC's of Beth", which proves his fatherly love for Beth and "Auto Erotic Assimilation", where he's being dumped by Unity made him depressed enough to cry. Rick frequently reminds people that he's above everything that could hold meaning or value to him and made "I don't give a fuck!" his new catchphrase in "Ricksy Business", but this is all a mask. Rick is shown to care about maintaining relationships with others and holds a sentimental value of his family.

Rick has the tendency to be possessive and dominating of Morty, believing the boy to be his own personal helper. This doesn't prevent Rick from genuinely caring about Morty. He occasionally uses his own inventions to improve his grandson's life, such as invading the dreams of Mr. Goldenfold to help raise his math grades, though this could have been a tactic for Morty to skip more school to go on adventures with Rick [36]. Rick also demonstrates being fairly protective of Morty, as shown in the episode "Meeseeks and Destroy", where he eventually sets aside his cynicism to allow Morty to have a positive adventure, and abruptly kills Mr. Jellybean as the two are leaving the fantasy world because of the previous attempted rape on Morty.[37] He even tried to sacrifice himself for Morty in A Rickle in Time and accepted death, that is until he saw a way out of dying. He cried when seeing pictures of Morty and remembering Morty as a newborn reaching out to him, when he was held captive by Evil Rick, causing Evil Rick to mock him for his irrational attachment for Morty. Nonetheless, to his core, Rick's love or at least apathy for Morty only goes so far as he can throw him under the carpet. The numerous adventures where he constantly hurts and abuses Morty verbally, undermines his achievements, physically bullies him, forces him to make unethical and traumatizing actions and completely breaks down his confidence and self-worth have pushed Morty to several breaking points. In The Rickshank Rickdemption, Morty shoots Rick after being berated by his grandfather and sister as a screw-up, though that was Rick's plan. However, unbeknownst to him was that Morty had the intention to kill and did not know the gun had a fake shot. By season 5, Rick acknowledges how unhealthy his relationship with his grandson is and replaces him in Forgetting Sarick Mortshall with two crows. It started as a exaggerated joke to once again take Morty down a peg, but he claims that the fact the two birds prove as useful on adventures as Morty, Rick states that in actuality Morty's worth is no more than his new sidekicks. However, Rick does reunite with Morty in the last episode when he discovers he served as the crows' rebound, not the other way around. Ironically this gave him a brief moment of the insignificance he makes Morty feel in comparison to him. However, once Evil Morty reveals himself in Rickmurai Jack and Morty is offered a choice between helping Rick who was pinned down or join his evil counterpart, he chose to help his grandpa. Rick even told Morty that in their situation, Evil Morty had the best position. Once Evil Morty accomplished his goal in destroying the one thing that gave Ricks their control and dominance in each respective universe, Rick and Morty barley escaped the exploding Citadel. Rick, lost for words and shocked, lost his ability to use portal travel and was no longer the smartest being in his universe. Yet, he had attained a newfound bond with his grandson.

Rick and Morty have a strong bond, even though their relationship is strained due to Rick's cynicism, alcoholism, lack of conventional morality, and his tendency to push aside other members of the Smith family. Rick's carelessness is prevalent around Jerry, as he clearly doesn't respect him in any sense, and his relationship with Beth can be tumultuous at times. In "Raising Gazorpazorp" and "Something Ricked This Way Comes", Summer tags along on some of Rick's adventures. Rick initially had very little interest in her, but over time as the two spent time together, they have begun to develop a closer bond.

Rick is shown to have trouble taking orders from others. He is anti-totalitarian. As a result, Rick tends to dislike people with authority and government officials. He refuses to join the Council of Ricks, because he views them as a government. He also calls the guards at Intergalactic Customs "robots" and claims that he doesn't respect them, as he deems them bureaucrats and doesn't like "being told where to go and what to do". Rick also has a great dislike of standardized education, claiming that school "isn't a place for smart people" and a "waste of time", and insists that things such as studying and homework are pointless and stupid. He also thoroughly despise compromise as seen with the Night-people, who became frustrated with having to do the the chores that the Smith family didn't want to do awake. Particularly rinsing the dishes which was hard to take off hours later. Not only did Rick refuse the Night-Smiths request to clean the dishes better before sleeping the first time, but even after a long escalation and fight for control of day and night (which Rick lost), and the Night-people willing to have a truce in exchange for the earlier request, Rick chose to rather lose his free will than subjugate to their offer.

Rick claims to be atheistic, but holds seemingly contradictory beliefs on religion. At one point, he tells Summer at the breakfast table in the pilot, "There is no God" — yet in the "Anatomy Park" episode, he tells the family "Do you realize that Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our savior was born today-are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?" Although, this comment was most likely sarcastic. He also quickly recognizes Mr. Needful as "the devil", and when he's under the impression that he is going to die while one of the other sixty-three Ricks is chasing after Morty's lost collar, actually kneels and prays, "Please God, if there's a Hell, please be merciful to me" (significantly, when no one is around). However, when the 1/64th Rick succeeds, he retracts his statement yells "Fuck you God, not today, bitch!" So, this allusion to religion may have just been a sarcastic comment. When the Ricks recombine in the presence of Summer and Morty, he once again says "I did it! There is no God! In your face!" It's possible this is just due to Rick's ego and his complete confidence in his own abilities. In fact, in “Mort: Ragnarick”, Rick himself acknowledges that he is too atheistic to be channeled to any afterlife at all.

Rick is most likely just atheistic making religious jokes and references, as, in "Never Ricking Morty," it is revealed that the most uncharacteristic act Rick would do is resort and pray to Jesus Christ, as it crashes the entire "story train"
